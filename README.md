Android Example of saving and emailing a crash log from UncaughtExceptionHandler

## What  (Introduction)

Another collection of code set up to save a crash log from the UncaughtExcpetionHandler and then launch another activity which will launch an email client to send the log.
Based on code from stackoverflow.com and put together into a working example.

## Why  (Motivation)

Demonstrate the starting of Activity with new process in order to send the log files.

## How  (Installation)

This is not in project format but just the needed source 'src' and resource 'res' files that should easily be imported into a new Android Studio or Eclipse project.

## Misc

Other examples found were incomplete or a mini-framework.  This is just putting things together to show a simple example.

Some things included:

- keep log files in directory on sdcard
- handle email on emulator as well as device
- also able to report non-fatal errors
